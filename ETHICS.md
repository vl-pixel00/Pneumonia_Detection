Ethical Considerations

For this project, I used two publicly available datasets from Kaggle:

Chest X-ray Pneumonia Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data

COVID-19 X-ray Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets

Both datasets are ethically sourced and do not include any personal information about the patients. They are meant for research and educational purposes, and I used them in line with their licensing rules.

The model was trained and tested on the pneumonia dataset, and only tested on the COVID-19 dataset to see how well it could generalise. However, the differences between the datasets, such as patient demographics or imaging techniques, and class imbalances might have affected the results to some degree.

This project is for educational purposes and is not meant to be deployed as of now, or by any means, replace professional medical diagnosis. If the model were to be used in a real-world scenario, it would need further validation and testing by qualified medical professionals.

I have also made sure to document my process and share my code to promote transparency and help others understand and build on this work if they so wish.
