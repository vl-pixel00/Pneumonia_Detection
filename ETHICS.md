# Ethical Considerations

## Data Sources

This project uses two publicly available datasets from Kaggle:

1. **Chest X-ray Pneumonia Dataset:**
   - Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia/data
   - Usage: Primary training and testing

2. **COVID-19 X-ray Dataset:**
   - Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khoongweihao/covid19-xray-dataset-train-test-sets
   - Usage: Generalisation testing only

Both datasets are ethically sourced and do not include any personal information about the patients. They are provided for research and educational purposes, and this project's usage complies with their licensing terms.

## Ethical Considerations in Implementation

### Data Privacy and Protection
- All data used is anonymous and publicly available
- No patient identifiable information is present in the datasets
- No additional data collection was performed

### Potential Biases and Limitations

1. **Dataset Characteristics:**
   - The datasets may have inherent biases in terms of patient demographics, imaging techniques, or equipment used
   - Class imbalances exist that may affect the model's performance and generalisability
   - Possible labelling errors in the training data

2. **Model Performance:**
   - The model shows bias toward the majority class (pneumonia)
   - Performance differences between validation and testing suggest potential distribution shifts
   - COVID-19 generalisation testing reveals limitations in detecting normal cases

3. **Intended Use:**
   - This project is for educational purposes only
   - The model is not validated for clinical use
   - The system should be considered a potential assistive tool, not a replacement for professional medical diagnosis

## Responsible AI Practices

1. **Transparency:**
   - Full documentation of model architectures and performance metrics
   - Open source code and methodology
   - Clear communication of limitations and biases

2. **Accountability:**
   - Recognition that AI systems in healthcare require rigorous clinical validation
   - Acknowledgement that deployment would require medical professional oversight

3. **Future Considerations:**
   - Any deployment would require:
     - Extensive clinical trials
     - Regulatory approval
     - Integration with existing medical workflows
     - Ongoing monitoring for bias and performance
     - Regular retraining with diverse data

By adhering to these ethical guidelines, this project aims to contribute to AI research in healthcare while acknowledging the significant responsibility that comes with developing technologies that could impact patient care.
